There is a famous 🚂 railway station 🚉 in PopPush City. 
The country there is incredibly hilly.🛤 The 🚞 station was built in the last century and unfortunately the funds 💰💰💰💸💸 were extremely limited at the time. 
It was possible to establish only a surface track. Moreover, it turned out that the station could be only a dead-end one and due to lack of space it could have only one track.
The local tradition is that every train arriving from the direction A continues in the direction B with coaches reorganised in some way. Assume that the train arriving from the direction A has N ≤ 1000 coaches numbered in increasing order 1, 2, …, N. 
The chief for train reorganisations must know whether it is possible to marshal coaches continuing in the direction B so that their order will be a1, a2, …, aN. 
Help him and write ✍(◔◡◔) a program that decides whether it is possible to get the required order of coaches.🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃
